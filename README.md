# Yanda's Blog V3

The blog is built based on my fork of [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://github.com/yodahuang/gatsby-starter-lumen). Other than the original feature, some new things are added:

- Infer date by file modified date
- No specific naming convention for post folder name, the system handles both `xxx---yyy` or just `xxx`
- Slug generation based on relative path
- Separate project section, which can be seen as a second blog
- For project section, support for both static and animated image as well as YouTube videos
- Other enhancements
    - enhance `iframe`' format in the post
    - code modularity enhancement

## Why Gatsby

Compared with other static site generator, Gatsby offers more customization and more fun. for example, a sub-blog is hard for `Jekyll` or `Hexo`. However, it is easy for `Gatsby`.
