I transfered my blog from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to [Hexo](https://jekyllrb.com)!

### Why am I doing this?

- Well, I find as my personal website, it shall not only have blog but also a bundle of my projects, works, resume, etc. So the former blog can't fit my need. 
- I find this [theme](https://github.com/forsigner/fexo) which loooks really good. 
- Hexo is written with Node.js, which indicates the possiblity that I can write some plugins for it someday.
- Oh it's beautiful! Who cares about why I use it? Isn't this single reason strong enough?

### Some difficulties I find

- Hexo is developed by a [Taiwanese student](https://zespia.tw/blog/2012/10/11/hexo-debut/).(Yes, a STUDENT!), which makes it friendly to Chinese users. However, this leads to a problem that unlike Jekyll, most of the resources of Hexo is written in Chinese! You can see Chinese in the code comments, in the theme you downloads and everywhere...
